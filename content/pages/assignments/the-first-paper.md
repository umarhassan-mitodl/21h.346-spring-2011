Topics
------

1.  How absolute was the absolutism of Louis XIV? Analyze Colbert's _Instructions for the Commissioners_ (Beik, 85-90) to respond to this question. \[Hint: you might want to review Bossuet's _Politics Derived from the Words of Holy Scripture_; and/or Beik's discussion of absolutism on 2-4.\]
  
3.  Why did Louis XIV institute the _Grands Jours_ in the Auvergne in 1665? (Beik, 108-20) In what ways did these unusual legal proceedings further the goals of the crown in the 1660s?
  
5.  At the end of _Tartuffe_, the royal officer who comes to arrest Tartuffe and restore order in Orgon's household has the following speech:  
    Our prince is not a friend to double dealing,  
    His eyes can read men's inmost hearts, and all  
    The art of hypocrites cannot deceive him.  
    His sharp discernment sees things clear and true;  
    His mind cannot too easily be swayed,  
    For reason always holds the balance even.  
    He honors and exalts true piety,  
    But knows the false, and views it with disgust.  
    This fellow was by no means apt to fool him,  
    Far subtler snares have failed against his wisdom,  
    And his quick insight pierced immediately  
    The hidden baseness of this tortuous heart.  
    \-_Tartuffe_, Act V, sc. 7

Based on this speech, and on the plot of the play, would you agree that Moli√®re is an unabashed apologist for Louis XIV, and that the point of his play is to glorify the absolute monarchy?
